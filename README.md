# Coding Problems

Collection of Algorithm and Data Structures challenges, with solutions in different languages.

#### Instructions

* Challenges are divided by difficulty
* Challenges are divided by related data-structure
	* This just implies a suitable data-structure that makes the solution easier to understand, but does not mean you cannot think of a better solution using a different data-structure.
* Each challenge includes a README.md with a description of a problem and some preconditions and restrictions such as time/space complexity.
* Example solutions are intended to be used once you come up with a solution on your own.
